# Automated-Heat-Transfer-Script

The following script is from my undergraduate dissertation
This was an attempt at creating a script allowing a user to create and export a textile model from an application called TexGen. Create a .inp file and edit it to be able to be input in Abaqus/CAE and perform a simple heat transfer analysis
Since tkinter was used for the TexGen GUI, it was also used as the GUI for the script for a simple user experience
